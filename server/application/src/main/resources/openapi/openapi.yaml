        Synchronizes the complete set of options for a sponsoring pack.
        
        This endpoint accepts a complete configuration of required and optional options
        and ensures the pack's final state exactly matches the submitted configuration by:
        - Removing options not included in the request
        - Adding new options from the request
        - Updating requirement status (required ↔ optional) for existing options
        
        The operation is atomic - all changes succeed or all fail. The operation is
        idempotent - submitting the same configuration multiple times produces the same result.
        
        Both required and optional lists can be empty to remove all options from the pack.

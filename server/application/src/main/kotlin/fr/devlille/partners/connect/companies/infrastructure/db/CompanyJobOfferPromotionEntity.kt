/**
 * Exposed entity for company job offer promotions.
 *
 * Represents a promotion request for a job offer through a partnership,
 * with approval workflow tracking. This entity bridges the company's job offers
 * with event partnerships, enabling organizers to review and approve promotions.
 *
 * **Relationship Semantics**:
 * - jobOffer: References the job offer being promoted (CASCADE DELETE)
 * - partnership: References the partnership through which promotion occurs (CASCADE DELETE)
 * - event: Denormalized reference to the event for efficient querying (CASCADE DELETE)
 * - reviewedBy: Optional reference to the user who reviewed (SET NULL on delete)
 *
 * **Cascade Behavior**:
 * - Deleting a job offer → deletes all its promotions
 * - Deleting a partnership → deletes all promotions through that partnership
 * - Deleting an event → deletes all promotions for that event
 * - Deleting a reviewer user → sets reviewedBy to null (preserves audit trail)
 *
 * **State Transitions**:
 * - PENDING → APPROVED (via organizer approval)
 * - PENDING → DECLINED (via organizer decline)
 * - DECLINED → PENDING (via company re-promotion/upsert)
 * - APPROVED and DECLINED are terminal states (cannot transition further)
 *
 * **Index Strategy**:
 * - Composite index on (jobOfferId, partnershipId) for duplicate prevention
 * - Index on partnershipId for organizer queries
 * - Index on eventId for event-level queries
 * - Index on status for filtering pending reviews

# Feature Specification: Event Sponsoring Packs Public API

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-new-get`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create new GET service in the sponsoring package to display the list of created pack by organizer of an event and their embedded and optional options. The service shouldn't be pagined because there isn't enough pack by event created by organizers and the service should be accessible for everyone interested by an event, so it is unauthenticated and the route start by /events/{eventSlug}/ instead of /orgs/{orgSlug}/events/{eventSlug}/."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Event attendees, partners, and potential sponsors want to view available sponsoring packages for a specific event to understand sponsorship opportunities without needing to authenticate or navigate complex organizational structures.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an event exists with sponsoring packages, **When** a user visits `/events/{eventSlug}/sponsoring/packs`, **Then** they see a complete list of all available sponsoring packages with their details
2. **Given** an event has sponsoring packages with embedded options, **When** a user requests the sponsoring packs, **Then** they receive packages with all embedded options included in the response
3. **Given** an event has sponsoring packages with optional add-ons, **When** a user views the packages, **Then** they see both the base package and available optional add-ons
4. **Given** an event has no sponsoring packages, **When** a user requests sponsoring packs, **Then** they receive an empty list with appropriate messaging
5. **Given** an invalid event slug is provided, **When** a user requests sponsoring packs, **Then** they receive a 404 error with clear messaging

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an event exists but has no published sponsoring packages?
- How does the system handle events that are cancelled or archived?
- What occurs when the event slug contains special characters or encoding issues?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a public GET endpoint at `/events/{eventSlug}/sponsoring/packs` that requires no authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST return all sponsoring packages created by the event organizers for the specified event
- **FR-003**: System MUST include embedded options as part of each sponsoring package in the response
- **FR-004**: System MUST include optional add-on options available for each sponsoring package
- **FR-005**: System MUST return the complete list without pagination since package volume per event is expected to be low
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that the event exists and return appropriate error responses for invalid event slugs
- **FR-007**: System MUST return packages in a consistent format with clear identification of embedded vs optional options
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle events with zero sponsoring packages gracefully by returning an empty list
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 404 for invalid event)
- **FR-010**: System MUST return response data in JSON format suitable for public consumption

### Key Entities
- **Event**: Represents an event identified by its unique slug, contains sponsoring packages created by organizers
- **Sponsoring Package**: Represents a sponsorship tier/package with pricing, benefits, and options created by event organizers
- **Embedded Options**: Required components that are automatically included in a sponsoring package
- **Optional Options**: Additional add-ons that sponsors can choose to include with their package for extra cost

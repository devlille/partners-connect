# Feature Specification: Multi-Language Sponsoring Pack and Option Management for Organizers

**Feature Branch**: `002-for-sponsoring-pack`  
**Created**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "For sponsoring pack and option services dedicated for organizers, under /orgs/{orgSlug} path, we should remove the Accept-Language header usage to return all translations of options to be able to know which language to add for existing options."

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An event organizer managing sponsoring packages and options needs to see all available language translations for existing options to understand which languages need translation work, rather than seeing only one language at a time based on their browser's Accept-Language header.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an event has sponsoring options with translations, **When** an organizer requests the options list via `/orgs/{orgSlug}/events/{eventSlug}/options`, **Then** they receive all options with complete translation information for all languages
2. **Given** an event has sponsoring packs with options that have partial translations, **When** an organizer requests the packs list via `/orgs/{orgSlug}/events/{eventSlug}/packs`, **Then** they can see which options need additional translations
3. **Given** an organizer wants to add a new language translation to an existing option, **When** they view the option details, **Then** they can see all existing translations and identify missing language support
4. **Given** multiple organizers work in different languages, **When** they access the same sponsoring options, **Then** they all see the complete translation data regardless of their Accept-Language header

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an option has no translations in any language?
- How does the system handle malformed translation data?
- What happens when an option has translations but some are incomplete (missing name or description)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST return sponsoring options with all available translations when organizers access `/orgs/{orgSlug}/events/{eventSlug}/options`
- **FR-002**: System MUST return sponsoring packs with embedded options containing all available translations when organizers access `/orgs/{orgSlug}/events/{eventSlug}/packs`
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT require the Accept-Language header for organizer-facing sponsoring pack and option endpoints under `/orgs/{orgSlug}` paths
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain existing authentication and authorization requirements for organizer endpoints
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality for public endpoints (those under `/events/{eventSlug}` paths) with Accept-Language header requirements unchanged
- **FR-006**: System MUST include complete translation objects with language code, name, and description for each available translation
- **FR-007**: System MUST return consistent data structure for options whether accessed through pack endpoints or option endpoints directly
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle cases where options have incomplete or missing translations gracefully without errors

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SponsoringOption**: Options with complete translation data including all available language versions with name, description, and language code
- **SponsoringPack**: Packages containing options with full translation information for organizer management needs
- **Translation**: Language-specific version of option content with language code, name, and optional description

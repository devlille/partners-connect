# Feature Specification: Job Offer Promotion with Approval Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-would-like`  
**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to create services that will let a user promote a job offer attached to a company with a partnership with an event and services in the organization (so that will require permission to an event) to accept or decline job offer submitted by the user. Note that these new services should use the notification integration to notify partnership contacts when a new offer has been created and when it has been accepted or declined (mailjet) and organization (slack)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: actors (company users, event organizers), actions (promote, accept, decline), data (job offers, partnerships, notifications)
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Job offer promotion workflow, approval/rejection process, notification integration
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to job offers after event ends?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can a declined job offer be re-submitted?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a limit on job offers per partnership?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What permission level is required for approval (owner only, or any event admin)?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: company promotes ‚Üí organizer reviews ‚Üí notification sent
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Promotion, approval, notification requirements identified
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí PromotedJobOffer, JobOfferPromotionRequest, NotificationVariables
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - 4 clarification markers present
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications needed)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-18
- Q: What happens to job offers after event ends? ‚Üí A: System returns 403 Forbidden when attempting to promote after event end date
- Q: When a declined job offer needs to be re-submitted to the same event, what should the system allow? ‚Üí A: Allow immediate re-promotion without changes (declined status reset to pending)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a company owner with an active partnership, I want to promote my job offers to an event so that event participants can discover employment opportunities. As an event organizer, I need to review and approve or decline promoted job offers to ensure quality and relevance to my event audience. When job offer statuses change, both the company contacts and organization team should receive automated notifications.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a company owner with an active partnership and existing job offers, **When** I promote a job offer to the partnership, **Then** the job offer is marked as "pending approval" and event organizers receive notifications via email (Mailjet) and Slack

2. **Given** I am an event organizer with permissions, **When** I review a pending job offer promotion and approve it, **Then** the job offer status changes to "approved", the company contacts receive approval notification via email, and the organization team receives Slack notification

3. **Given** I am an event organizer with permissions, **When** I review a pending job offer promotion and decline it, **Then** the job offer status changes to "declined", the company contacts receive decline notification via email with reason, and the organization team receives Slack notification

4. **Given** I am a company owner, **When** I attempt to promote a job offer without an active partnership, **Then** the system prevents the promotion and returns a permission error

5. **Given** I am a user without event permissions, **When** I attempt to approve or decline a job offer promotion, **Then** the system denies access and returns an authorization error

6. **Given** a job offer is promoted to multiple events through different partnerships, **When** one event approves and another declines, **Then** each promotion maintains its independent status and notifications are sent to respective parties

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a job offer is promoted but then deleted before approval/decline? System cascades deletion to all associated promotions, removing them entirely from the system.
- How does system handle job offers after the event date has passed? System prevents new promotions and returns 403 Forbidden error when attempting to promote after event end date.
- What happens if a partnership is terminated while job offers are pending approval? Promotions remain in pending state without automatic decline or deletion, allowing manual review if partnership is restored.
- Can a company re-promote a declined job offer to the same event? Yes, system allows immediate re-promotion which resets status from declined to pending.
- What if notification services (Mailjet/Slack) are unavailable during status changes? Should the status change be rolled back or proceed with failed notification logging?
- How are notifications handled when partnership has no contact emails defined?
- Is there a maximum number of job offers that can be promoted per partnership? No, system allows unlimited job offer promotions per partnership without restrictions.

All constitutional requirements are satisfied, task coverage is complete, and artifacts are internally consistent. However, **one critical ambiguity** regarding permission type filtering requires immediate clarification before implementation begins.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Requirements**: 13 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-013)
- **Tasks**: 23 executable tasks (6-7 hour estimate)
- **Test Coverage**: 9 HTTP route integration tests
- **Constitution Compliance**: ✅ ALL principles satisfied
- **Issues Found**: 1 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 0 LOW

## Findings Summary

| ID | Category | Severity | Location | Summary |
|----|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| A-001 | Specification | **CRITICAL** | FR-003a, quickstart.md | Permission type filtering ambiguity - implementation contradicts requirement |
| A-002 | Coverage | MEDIUM | tasks.md T005-T013 | Missing test for duplicate email deduplication edge case |
| A-003 | Documentation | MEDIUM | contracts/ vs tasks.md | Test count mismatch (10 scenarios vs 9 tests) |

## Critical Issue Details

### A-001: Permission Type Filtering Ambiguity (CRITICAL)

**Description**: FR-003a states "System MUST only revoke edit permissions; view-only permissions are out of scope" but the implementation in quickstart.md (lines 195-210) conditionally deletes permissions:

```kotlin
if (permission != null && permission.canEdit) {
    permission.delete()  // ✅ Deletes edit permissions
    revokedCount++
} else if (permission == null) {
    notFoundEmails.add(email)
}
// If permission exists but canEdit=false, do nothing (out of scope per FR-003a)
```

**Analysis**:
The implementation correctly checks `permission.canEdit` before deletion, which means:
- ✅ Edit permissions (`canEdit=true`) are revoked
- ✅ View permissions (`canEdit=false`) are ignored (not revoked)
- ✅ Behavior matches FR-003a requirement

**However**, the specification language is ambiguous:
- Does "only revoke edit permissions" mean:
  1. **Filter approach**: Only delete permissions where `canEdit=true` (current implementation)
  2. **Scope limitation**: Feature only handles edit-level access, view permissions are separate feature

**Evidence from Codebase**:
- Existing `grantUsers()` method (UserRepositoryExposed.kt:46-66) ALWAYS sets `canEdit=true`
- No evidence of view-only permission management in users module
- Grant endpoint only creates/updates edit permissions

**Conclusion**: Implementation is **likely correct** (filter approach), but specification needs explicit confirmation.

**Recommendation**:
✅ **PROCEED with current implementation** - the conditional check `permission.canEdit` ensures only edit permissions are revoked, which satisfies FR-003a. Add explicit test scenario to verify view permissions are not affected.

**Required Action**:
1. Add test case to T005 or create T014: "Given user has view permission, When revoke is called, Then view permission remains unchanged"
2. Update FR-003a wording: "System MUST filter permissions to only revoke those with canEdit=true; view-only permissions (canEdit=false) are not affected by this operation"

**Impact**: MEDIUM (implementation is correct, only documentation clarity needed)

---

## Medium Severity Issues

### A-002: Missing Duplicate Email Test (MEDIUM)

**Description**: spec.md edge cases list "What happens when I provide duplicate email addresses in the list? The system should deduplicate and process each unique email once" but tasks.md does not include a test for this scenario.

**Evidence**:
- quickstart.md line 159: `val uniqueEmails = userEmails.distinct()`
- Implementation handles deduplication correctly
- No test validates this behavior

**Impact**: Edge case not validated in test suite

**Recommendation**: 
Add test task between T013 and T014:
```
T013.5 [P] Test: Duplicate email deduplication
- File: RevokePermissionRouteTest.kt
- Method: `deduplicate email addresses()`
- Setup: Create org with alice (has permission)
- Action: POST /revoke with ["alice@example.com", "alice@example.com"]
- Assert: HTTP 200, revoked_count=1 (not 2), alice revoked only once
```

**Priority**: LOW (implementation is correct, test adds defensive validation)

---

### A-003: Test Count Discrepancy (MEDIUM)

**Description**: contracts/revoke-users.md specifies 10 test scenarios but tasks.md only includes 9 tests (T005-T013).

**Analysis**:
- Contracts Test 1-8: Mapped to T005-T013 ✅
- Contracts Test 9: Bad Request - Invalid Email → **Missing** in tasks
- Contracts Test 10: Bad Request - Missing Field → **Missing** in tasks

**Why Missing**:
- JSON schema validation (T016) handles both scenarios automatically
- Schema enforces `format: email` (catches Test 9)
- Schema enforces `required: ["user_emails"]` (catches Test 10)
- Ktor's JSON validation returns 400 automatically

**Conclusion**: Tests 9-10 are **implicitly covered** by schema validation, not explicit test methods.

**Recommendation**:
✅ **ACCEPTABLE** - Schema validation provides coverage. If desired, add explicit validation tests:
```
T013.6 [P] Test: Invalid email format rejected by schema
T013.7 [P] Test: Missing user_emails field rejected by schema
```

**Priority**: LOW (coverage exists through schema validation)

## Constitution Alignment

### ✅ All 5 Core Principles Satisfied

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| I. Code Quality | ✅ PASS | plan.md confirms ktlint/detekt enforcement, 80% coverage (T024), KDoc required |
| II. Testing | ✅ PASS | Tasks use HTTP route integration tests (T005-T013), NOT repository tests |
| III. Clean Architecture | ✅ PASS | Repository pattern (T018-T019), no circular dependencies, existing entities reused |
| IV. API Consistency | ✅ PASS | StatusPages exception handling, AuthorizedOrganisationPlugin, REST conventions |
| V. Performance | ✅ PASS | Indexed queries (existing), <2s response time, structured logging via Ktor |

### Specific Constitutional Compliance

**Authorization Pattern**: ✅ CORRECT
- quickstart.md shows `install(AuthorizedOrganisationPlugin)` usage
- No manual permission checking in route handler
- Matches constitution requirement

**Exception Handling**: ✅ CORRECT
- Repository throws `NotFoundException`, `ConflictException`
- No try-catch blocks in route handler
- StatusPages handles exception-to-HTTP mapping

**Repository Separation**: ✅ CORRECT
- UserRepository implementation has NO dependencies on other repositories
- No cross-domain operations in repository layer
- Follows constitution's repository layer rules

**Database Pattern**: ✅ CORRECT
- Uses existing OrganisationPermissionEntity (no schema changes)
- Exposed ORM with proper transaction management
- No timestamp() usage (constitution violation would be present in new tables)

## Task Execution Readiness

### Dependency Graph: ✅ VALID

```
Phase 3.2 (Tests) ─────┐
    │                  │
    ├─ T004 (Skeleton) │
    │    │              │
    │    └─ T005-T013   │  [All must FAIL before proceeding]
    │         (9 tests) │
    │                   │
Phase 3.3 (Core) ◄──────┘
    │
    ├─ T014-T017 (Models, Schema) [P] ← Parallel
    │
    ├─ T018 (Interface)
    │    └─ T019 (Implementation)  ← Sequential (same files)
    │         └─ T020 (Route)      ← Depends on T019
    │
Phase 3.4 (Integration)
    │
    └─ T021-T022 ◄─ Depends on T004-T020
         │
Phase 3.5 (Polish)
         │
         └─ T023-T024 [P] ← Parallel
```

**Validation**: ✅ No circular dependencies, clear execution order

### Parallelization Strategy: ✅ CORRECT

**Batch 1** (after T004): T005-T013 (9 test methods, same file) → ✅ Valid  
**Batch 2**: T014-T017 (4 different files) → ✅ Valid  
**Batch 3**: T023-T024 (documentation, coverage) → ✅ Valid

**File Conflicts**: None - all [P] tasks modify different files

## Recommendations

### Before Implementation Starts

1. **CRITICAL**: Clarify FR-003a intent (likely already correct - see A-001)
2. **OPTIONAL**: Add T013.5 for duplicate email test (defensive validation)
3. **OPTIONAL**: Add T013.6-T013.7 for explicit schema validation tests

### During Implementation

1. Follow TDD strictly: T005-T013 MUST fail before T014-T020
2. Run `./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt --no-daemon` after each phase
3. Commit after each phase (T004-T013, T014-T017, T018-T020, T021-T024)

### Post-Implementation

1. Verify test coverage ≥80% via T024 (JaCoCo report)
2. Update OpenAPI spec per T023 and validate with `npm run validate`
3. Test idempotency manually with real database (edge case validation)
